https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?q=London,us&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22
The above API is the REST GET API
Which gives you the response in JSON format and hourly weather forecast of London Location

I want you to write a program to get the option from the user and print the result based on the above API.
1. Get weather
2. Get Wind Speed
3. Get Pressure
0. Exit

If the user press 1, Prompt the user for the date then print the temp of the input date.
If the user press 2, Prompt the user for the date then print the wind.speed of the input date.
If the user press 3, Prompt the user for the date then print the pressure of the input date.
If the user press 0, Terminate the program.

The program should not terminate until the user press 0
